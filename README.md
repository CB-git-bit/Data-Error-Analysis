**README - Data Error Analysis School Work**

This repository contains my school work on data error analysis, specifically three assignments (Assignment 1 to Assignment 3). The purpose of sharing these assignments is to showcase my understanding and application of various concepts related to error analysis and statistical data modeling.

Please note that the PDF files of the Jupyter notebooks are provided instead of the actual code to prevent potential plagiarism by other students currently enrolled in the course. It is important to emphasize that copying or plagiarizing these assignments is strictly prohibited and goes against academic integrity principles. The purpose of sharing these materials is for reference and learning purposes only.

**Assignments:**

1. **Assignment 1 - Describing Data:** This assignment focuses on understanding the motivations behind developing a strong understanding of data. It also includes an introduction to programming in Python, assigning uncertainties, propagating uncertainties, and analyzing statistical distributions. The PDF file for Assignment 1 can be found [here](https://github.com/CB-git-bit/Data-Error-Analysis/blob/main/P252-A1-CBisol.pdf).

2. **Assignment 2 - Modelling Statistical Data:** The second assignment delves into statistical distributions, hypothesis testing, the Normal distribution, and modeling experimental data. It builds upon the concepts covered in Assignment 1 and explores more advanced statistical techniques. The PDF file for Assignment 2 can be accessed [here](https://github.com/CB-git-bit/Data-Error-Analysis/blob/main/P252-A2-CBisol.pdf).

3. **Assignment 3 - Comparing Data & Model:** The third assignment focuses on comparing data and models, understanding the meaning of probabilities, and employing the Monte Carlo method for statistical analysis. It builds on the knowledge gained from the previous assignments and applies it to real-world scenarios. The PDF file for Assignment 3 is available [here](https://github.com/CB-git-bit/Data-Error-Analysis/blob/main/P252-A3-CBisol.pdf).

These assignments cover various topics essential for comprehending data error analysis and statistical modeling. They serve as a demonstration of my proficiency in analyzing and interpreting statistical data, as well as my ability to utilize programming skills in Python for data analysis.
